# Misc Thoughts

This is a place to put miscellaneous thoughts about the project, things to add or change, more features, things to do differently, etc. 

Project flow: 

For every new bit of work, create a "DayX.md" file with a feature list. Take notes as you go. Then, when the features are complete, submit a PR to main.
